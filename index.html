<h1>Financial Analysis of Malaysia’s 10 Largest Companies (2025)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Malaysia’s corporate landscape features a mix of banking, energy, healthcare, telecommunications and plantation businesses. This page analyses the ten largest Malaysian companies by market capitalisation as of September 2025—Maybank, Public Bank, CIMB Group, Tenaga Nasional, IHH Healthcare, Press Metal Aluminium, CelcomDigi, Hong Leong Bank, Petronas Gas and Sime Darby Plantation. Market-value data and trailing‑twelve‑month (TTM) revenue figures were obtained from <em>companiesmarketcap.com</em> and <em>StockAnalysis.com</em>. Currency conversions use average 2025 exchange rates (SGD→USD ≈ 0.7619, CAD→USD ≈ 0.7146, MYR→USD ≈ 0.2307).</p>

<h2>Market capitalisation</h2>
<p>Maybank remains Malaysia’s largest listed company with a market value close to USD 30 billion. Public Bank and CIMB Group rank second and third. Sime Darby Plantation and Petronas Gas are the smallest among the group with market values around USD 8 billion. The bar chart below compares market capitalisation with revenue.</p>

<h2>Revenue analysis</h2>
<p>Tenaga Nasional is the revenue leader with TTM revenue above USD 14 billion, reflecting its role as the national electricity provider. Maybank generates about USD 6.6 billion in revenue, while Public Bank records roughly USD 3.4 billion. For companies reporting revenue in other currencies, figures were converted to USD using average 2025 exchange rates.</p>
<p>CIMB Group’s C$6.98 billion revenue converts to roughly USD 5.0 billion; IHH Healthcare’s SGD 7.54 billion revenue converts to about USD 5.7 billion. Hong Leong Bank’s MYR 6.78 billion revenue becomes USD 1.56 billion, and Petronas Gas’s MYR 6.46 billion translates to USD 1.49 billion.</p>

<h2>Comparative insights</h2>
<h3>Relationship between market value and revenue</h3>
<p>The scatter plot shows that Tenaga Nasional lies above the general trend line, indicating particularly high revenue relative to its market value. Maybank’s larger market cap relative to its revenue suggests investors value its profitability and dividends. Smaller banks like Hong Leong Bank occupy the lower left corner of the plot, reflecting niche positions.</p>

<h3>Revenue‑to‑market‑cap ratio</h3>
<p>Dividing revenue by market cap shows which companies generate the most sales per dollar of valuation. Tenaga Nasional produces roughly USD 0.80 of revenue for every USD 1 of market value, far more than peers. Sime Darby Plantation also has a high revenue‑to‑value ratio (~0.58) because plantation earnings depend on commodity prices and are high relative to its market capitalisation. Maybank and Public Bank yield lower ratios (≈0.22 and 0.17) because investors price their banking earnings power more heavily than their absolute sales volumes.</p>

<h2>Sectoral highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banking:</strong> Maybank, Public Bank, CIMB Group and Hong Leong Bank dominate the list. Their valuations are high relative to revenue because bank earnings depend on interest margins and fee income rather than large sales figures.</li>
<li><strong>Utilities:</strong> Tenaga Nasional’s regulated monopoly as Malaysia’s national power company makes it the revenue powerhouse of the group.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> IHH Healthcare operates hospitals and clinics throughout Asia. Its moderate revenue‑to‑value ratio reflects investor expectations of growth.</li>
<li><strong>Telecoms & metals:</strong> CelcomDigi and Press Metal Aluminium are mid‑sized players. CelcomDigi benefits from the 2022 merger of Celcom and Digi, while Press Metal Aluminium gains from global aluminium demand.</li>
<li><strong>Plantation & natural gas:</strong> Sime Darby Plantation depends on palm‑oil prices, and Petronas Gas operates gas processing and transmission infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This analysis highlights the diversity of Malaysia’s corporate giants. Banking companies command the largest market valuations despite modest revenues, signalling investor confidence in their stability and earnings potential. Tenaga Nasional stands out for its high revenue relative to market value. Commodity‑linked firms like Sime Darby Plantation and Press Metal Aluminium show high revenue‑to‑value ratios but face cyclical risks. Healthcare and telecommunications firms offer growth opportunities. Collectively, these ten companies underpin Malaysia’s economy and provide insight into sectoral strengths and investment sentiment in 2025.</p>
